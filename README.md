# Space-Trader

This is a remake of the classic game Space Trader. The idea is to buy a ship, fly around different planets, buy and sell cargo, and eventually make enough money to buy a moon and retire.

This is a very simple implementation of the game done by Arvind Narayan, Thao Vo, Ishaan Rajan, and myself for the Fall 2014 section of CS 2340: Objects and Design at Georgia Tech.

The original project was managed on GitHub in a private repository due to our misunderstanding of what that entailed. Due to this, I have moved the code to my personal repository with my team members' permission. The project was done using Intellij IDE and run on the IDE. I will work on making an executable jar file that will allow those without the idea to run the game.
